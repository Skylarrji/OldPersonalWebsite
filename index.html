        <p class="intro"> 👋 Hi! I'm Skylar, a <span class="CS">first-year Computer Science</span> student at the <span
            class="CS">University of Waterloo.</span> </p>

        <p class="intro"> <strong>At the core of everything I do, </strong> I utilize technology, volunteering and my
          own experiences (the good and the bad) to <strong>change the way people think about and interact with
            themselves and those around them.</strong> </p>

        <p class="intro"> In the summer of 2022, I completed an internship at <span class="work">RBC</span> as part of
          their Summer Tech Labs program, where I worked on an internal secure URL shortener using <span
            class="work">React, FastAPI, and MariaDB,</span> projected to improve the experience for <span
            class="work">85,000+</span> RBC employees. Some other notable projects I've completed in my spare time
          include a Christmas Countdown <span class="work">Chrome extension</span>, a <span class="work">Python
            AI</span> Battlesnake and an interactive <span class="work">recipe adjuster.</span> </p>

        <p class="intro"> <strong>I believe the best way to create change is by taking initiative.</strong> This inspired me
          to found <span class="leap">LEAP</span> (Learning through Experiences And People) and <span class="UUA">United
            Under Arts Waterloo </span> in high school. I also gave back to my community by being involved with <span
            class="SVP">SVP Teens, </span> being a <span class="Camp"> summer camp counsellor </span> and donating <span
            class="mask"> 50 mask headbands </span> to a local cancer centre. </p>

        <p class="intro"> In my spare time, I enjoy writing posts on <span class="posts"> LinkedIn and Medium
            </span> in terms of my previous life experiences and what I've learned from them, especially
          topics such as insecurities, rejection, and mental health. </p>

        <p class="intro"> <strong>I'm open to giving advice and chatting with new people, so don't hesitate to reach
            out!</strong></p>
