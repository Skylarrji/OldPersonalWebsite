        <p class="intro"> 👋 Hi! I'm Skylar, a <span class="CS">second-year Computer Science</span> student at the <span
            class="CS">University of Waterloo.</span> </p>

        <p class="intro"> <strong>At the core of everything I do, </strong> I utilize technology, volunteering and my
          own experiences (the good and the not so good) to <strong>change the way people think about and interact with
            themselves and those around them.</strong> </p>

        <p class="intro"> In the summer of 2023, I completed an internship at <span class="work">RBC</span> as a DevOps Engineer, where I worked on a dashboard and pipelines using <span
            class="work">Splunk, Zsh and Jenkins,</span> reducing the company's mean time to recovery by <span
            class="work">98%.</span> Some other notable projects I've completed in my spare time
          include a full-stack <span class="work">article sharing 
 webapp</span>, a <span class="work">Python
            AI</span> Battlesnake and an interactive <span class="work">recipe adjuster.</span> </p>

        <p class="intro"> <strong>I believe the best way to create change is by taking initiative.</strong> This inspired me to become a design lead for <span class="wish">UW Make-A-Wish</span> and an event coordinator for <span class="cooking">UW Cooking Club.</span>
          In addition, I was motivated to found <span class="leap">LEAP</span> (Learning through Experiences And People) and <span class="UUA">United
            Under Arts Waterloo </span> in high school. Finally, I was a participant of <span class="rbc"> RBC Summer Tech Labs'</span> internship program in 2022 and a SHAD 2021 fellow. </p> 

        <p class="intro"> In my spare time, I enjoy writing posts on <span class="posts"> LinkedIn and Medium
            </span> in terms of my previous life experiences and what I've learned from them, especially
          topics such as insecurities, rejection, and mental health. </p>

        <p class="intro"> <strong>I'm open to giving advice and chatting with new people, so don't hesitate to reach
            out!</strong></p>
